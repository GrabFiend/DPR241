<p>
Im currently a Mobile Computing major at Delaware County Community College. 
Through these programs, I am "honing" my programing skills with mobile devices and design methods 
to improve UI. This is mainly a "side" job as its not my main passion. My main passion is Music Production and 
I've been honing my craft mostly in that particular field for 5+ years. But dont count me out just yet, I have learning programing for 
3+ years and somewhat confident to get the job done
