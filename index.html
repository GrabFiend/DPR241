  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Im currently a Mobile Computing major at Delaware County Community College. 
Through these programs, I am "honing" my programing skills with mobile devices and design methods 
to improve UI. This is mainly a "side" job as its not my main passion. My main passion is Music Production and 
I've been honing my craft mostly in that particular field for 5+ years. But dont count me out just yet, I have learning programing for 
3+ years and somewhat confident to get the job done

 <h2>Big Plans</h2>
 <p>I am currently working with young local rapper by the name of Apollo COS and another artist by the name of Nanida9(A$TRO) with beats that I make within my free time. Though, obtaining fame and lifetime connections will take a long time but I shall remain dilligent. My main genre is Hip Hop but to be more specific, Trap and Drill is my forte. With that in mind, I am learning to expand my palette to create more complex and flexible pieces. </p>
